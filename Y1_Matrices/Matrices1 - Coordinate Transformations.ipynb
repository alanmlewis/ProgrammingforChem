For example, think about what happens when we reflect the orbitals in the blue plane. Most orbitals are not changed; the two hydrogen orbitals swap positions, and the O(2p$_x$) orbital changes sign. We can write a matrix which has this effect as follows:\n","\n","$\\textbf{R}_\\textrm{blue} = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccccc} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n","0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n","0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n","0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n","0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n","0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n","0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right)$\n","\n","If you're not sure, try multiplying the vector above by this matrix.\n","\n","We can define a variable which describes this transformation:"],"metadata":{"id":"Hulmh07eENnH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a 7x7 matrix full of zeros\n","ref_blue = np.zeros((7,7))\n","\n","# Fill in the non-zero elements to match the matrix above\n","ref_blue[0,0] = 1\n","ref_blue[1,1] = 1\n","ref_blue[2,2] = -1\n","ref_blue[3,3] = 1\n","ref_blue[4,4] = 1\n","ref_blue[5,6] = 1\n","ref_blue[6,5] = 1\n","\n","print(ref_blue)"],"metadata":{"id":"1e3juEDi8Hp-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<font color='#3366CC'>**Exercise 1:** Define matrices which describe how this basis is transformed by a rotation by 180 degrees (this is called a C$_2$ rotation), and by a reflection in the red plane."],"metadata":{"id":"AD2ggCiV8oM2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"h_bvBvTk8ncE"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<font color='#3366CC'>**Exercise 2:** Group theory says that any combination of symmetry operations must be the same as one of the symmetry operations in the group (this can be the identity).

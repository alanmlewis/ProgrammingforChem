However, we haven't talked about how to divide matrices by other matrices. This is more complicated than multiplying matrices together. In fact, we don't usually talk about dividing by a matrix at all; instead, we talk about **multiplying by its inverse**.

This is similar to dividing - multiplying a number by its \"inverse\" (i.e. one divided by that number) is the same as dividing by that number, and always gives an answer of 1. In terms of the coordinate transformations we talked about last week, an inverse matrix will undo a coordinate transformation.\n","\n","It is only possible to define the inverse of a matrix $\\textbf{A}$ if a quantity known as the determinant of the matrix (written as $\\textrm{det } \\textbf{A}$ or $|\\textbf{A}|$) is non-zero. If $\\textrm{det } \\textbf{A} = 0$, then $\\textbf{A}$ is said to be \"singular\" and $\\textbf{A}^{-1}$ does not exist.\n","\n","**Very roughly**, in terms of the coordinate transformation we saw last week, a determinant tells you how much the area of a shape will change when apply a coordinate transformation. For example, a rotation matrix $\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{array} \\right)$ won't change the area at all, but a matrix which stretches in the $x$ and $y$ dimensions $\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{array} \\right)$ will change the area of a shape by a factor of 4. If the determinant is zero, the shape disappears entirely as its area becomes 0, and it's not possible to undo that - there is no inverse.
